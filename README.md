## Description

`push_swap` is a 42 project that challenges students to create an efficient sorting algorithm to sort a stack of numbers with a limited set of operations. The aim is to sort the stack using the least number of moves possible. This project implements the "Turk algorithm," a strategic approach to solving the problem as discussed in [this article](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97). The algorithm works by calculating which move will take the least amount of moves to get the lists closer to being sorted.


## Base Features

- Sort a stack of integers using two stacks and a limited set of operations.
- Check for errors and handle non-integer and duplicate inputs.
- Print the list of operations needed to sort the stack.

## Bonus Functionality

The bonus part of `push_swap` introduces additional features:

- **Checker Program**: A separate program that checks if the stack is sorted after applying the operations given by `push_swap`.

## Usage 

To clone the repository use:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moop250/push_swap.git
```

Compilation & cleanup:

- `make` : Compiles the push_swap program.
- `make bonus` : Compiles the checker program.
- `make all` : Compiles both the push_swap and checker programs.
- `make clean` : Cleans up object files (.o).
- `make fclean` : Cleans up all files generated by running make, including executables.
- `make re` : Performs a make fclean followed by a make all to recompile the programs.

Example usage of push_swap:
```C
ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG
```

Example usage with checker bonus:
```C
ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```
